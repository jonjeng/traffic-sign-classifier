# traffic-sign-classifier
___

This repository contains an implementation of a CNN model based on LeNet-5 and a multi-stage CNN based on that by Sermanet and LeCun ([2011](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf)). The models are applied to the classification of German traffic signs from GTRSB, Getty Images, and bicyclegermany.com. This data, as well as an ipython notebook detailing the process are included. 

The data used to initially train and test the models are originally from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and are not included.

The specific files included are:
* Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb: an ipython notebook detailing the process (e.g., exploring the data and designing, creating, and using the model)
* TSR_Writeup.md: a writeup of the process
* writeup_images: a directory containing the images contained in the writeup
* sign_images: a directory containing images of German traffic signs obtained from Getty Images and bicyclegermany.com
